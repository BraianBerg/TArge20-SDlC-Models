     <ul>
         <li>Git is a version control system and allows you to manage your source code history efficiently.</li>
         <li>These terms can be confusing, especially for beginners. Git is a version control system which you can download to your computer, GitHub is a hosting & collaboration provider which hosts your Git projects.</li>

     <h2>The Main Commands</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>git init - will turn our project into a project managed by Git. You should see the Initialized empty Git Repository info in your terminal, confirming that Git now monitors the project.</li>
         <li>git status - provides information about the current state.</li>
         <li>git add . - which will track changes in all files inside the Repository.</li>
         <li> git commit -m -adds the latest version of the code to our Branch, -m should provide a meaningful Commit message.</li>
     </ul>

     <h1>Github cloud notes</h1>
     <ul>
         <li>Each Commit contains a unique ID, the author, the date and the Commit message (this -m "your message" part). “HEAD” just points to the latest Commit of our current Branch, more on that in the next chapter.</li>
         <li>The master Branch which contains your currently stable and running version of your website</li>
         <li>The feature Branch where you’re currently working on a new feature</li>
     </ul>
     <h1>Github cloud commands</h1>
     <ul>
         <li>git branch -lists all Branches in our Repository.</li>
         <li>git log -in our terminal will display all Commits inside our Branch</li>
         <li>git checkout -b creates a new Branch based on the latest Commit of the Branch you’re currently working in.</li>
         <li>git checkout -b new-feature will create that new Branch named “new-feature”</li>
         <li>git add . and git commit -m "css added" will create a new Commit with these changes in our “new-feature” Branch.</li>
         
     </ul>
